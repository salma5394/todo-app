# todo-app

My full-stack to-do app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQLite.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap for basic styling)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- PHP
- SQLite
- XAMPP

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or not
- Delete tasks
- Data is saved in a local SQLite database

## How to Run the Project

1. Download and install XAMPP
2. Copy the `todo-app` folder into `C:/xampp/htdocs/`
3. Open XAMPP and start the Apache module
4. In your browser, go to `http://localhost/todo-app/frontend/index.html`
5. The app should be running locally

## Notes

- The project uses PHP for the backend and SQLite as the database
- All data is stored locally in `todo.db`
- Requires a local server (Apache in XAMPP) to run properly
